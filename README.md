# **📜PROJECT DESCRIPTION:**
```html
DHL is an international Umbrella brand and trademark for the courier, package delivery, and
express mail service which is a division of the German logistics firm Deutsche Post. The
company group delivers over 1.6 billion parcels per year.
The company DHL itself was founded in San Francisco, USA, in 1969 and expanded its service
throughout the world by the late 1970s. In 1979, under the name of DHL Air Cargo, the
company entered the Hawaiian Islands with an inter-island cargo service using two DC-3 and
four DC-6 aircraft. Adrian Dalsey and Larry Hillblom personally oversaw the daily operations
until its eventual bankruptcy closed the doors in 1983. At its peak, DHL Air Cargo employed
just over 100 workers, management, and pilots.
